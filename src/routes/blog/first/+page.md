### Hello!

I am very excited to welcome you to my new blog (and portfolio).

I wanted to have something on the internet where people could find me, and now I will.

I would like to check that a few things work:

<img alt="(c) Pawel Czerwinski, Unsplash" src="/blog_assets/photo-1609709725221-d3c6bdadc166.jpg" width="200"/>

Wow that's an image. Yay. "quote here"

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello website);
}
```
